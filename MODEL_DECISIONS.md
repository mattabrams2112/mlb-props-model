# Model Decisions Log

A running record of *why* the rating/projection/betting logic is the way it is —
so decisions don't get re-litigated from scratch. Newest first. Dates are ET.

## 2026-07-22 — Boom-or-bust penalty: tried, then removed (UNSUPPORTED, not disproven)

**What:** Added then removed a rating penalty that docked plays whose projection
sat far above the batter's own recent baseline (`boom_delta = projected − r30g`),
on the theory that these are matchup-stacked "boom-or-bust" spots that bust to 0.

**Why removed:** The `boom_delta` reconstruction (Analytics → API-pull view) over
the 90-94 band, June 18→Jul 22, **n=17**, window=10:
- Wins avg boom_delta **+1.72**, losses **+0.95**, separation (L−W) **−0.77**.
- Sorted by boom_delta the W/L rows were fully interleaved (W,W,L,W,L,W,L,L,L,W) —
  no knee. The two most over-projected plays were both **wins**.
- So the signal is not predictive **at this sample**, and worse, mildly backwards.

**Important caveat:** 17 plays reconstructed from API calls is thin. Read this as
**"unsupported so far,"** NOT "proven wrong forever." Only window=10 was tested;
a longer baseline (20/30g) was not yet checked when it was pulled.

**Why pulled from production anyway:** an unvalidated penalty was actively shaving
points off live 85-89 / 95+ bets. Testing a hypothesis and betting real units on
it are different bars — remove from prod, keep testing.

**Re-test path:** `r30g` is now logged with every play (clean, live 30g HRR
baseline, no leakage — unlike the polluted historical actuals). In a few weeks
there's a much larger clean sample to re-check whether `boom_delta` (or a variant:
baseline *level* rather than the gap; longer windows; ratio vs difference) has
signal. One faint lead from the n=17 read: **wins had slightly higher real recent
form (~3.0 vs ~2.6 baseline)** — i.e. the baseline itself, not the gap, may matter.

**Kept (independent of this hypothesis):**
- Projection cap (re-cap final projection at the player's realistic ceiling) —
  about honest Edge numbers, not W/L prediction. Still valid.
- 90-94 fade — strengthened by this result: no `boom_delta` filter rescues the
  good 90-94 plays, so the blanket fade is the honest call, not a crude one.

## 2026-07-22 — Drop 90-94 from tracked bets (keep 95+)

Diagnostics (band diagnostic + three time windows) showed 90-94 over-projects
~2.5 HRR and wins only ~41%, driven by matchup-stacking selecting boom-or-bust
hitters. From `CAP_DATE` (2026-07-22) forward, ratings in [90, 95) are no longer
tracked bets; 95+ is kept. Date-gated in `bet_config.py` — days before CAP_DATE
keep their 90-94 plays unchanged.

## 2026-07-21 — Add 80-84 tier at 0.5u

80-84 tracked as bets at 0.5u ($4) from `EXPANSION_DATE` (2026-07-21). 85+ stays
1u. Date-gated so prior days remain 85+-only and past records don't move.
Central config in `bet_config.py`.

## ~2026-07 — Bet threshold 85+, flat 1u, strict real-line grading

Raised qualifying rating to 85+, flat 1u staking, and stopped auto-grading no-line
plays against a fake 1.5 (that inflated win rates). Analytics/Weekly still grade
no-line plays vs a 1.5 benchmark for research only (never written to the DB).

## 2026-06-18 — Current projection model

Pitcher multiplier reweighted to ERA 28% / FIP 22% / WHIP 20% / K% 18% / BB% 12%
(+ BvP when ≥10 AB). This is the current model — evaluate the model against data
from this date forward.
